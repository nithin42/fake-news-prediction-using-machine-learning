>Problem i am solving ?

>I am using machine learning technique to predict the Fake news using Lemmatizer and TfidfVectorizer
 
>Why does someone need this?

>As the technology is increasing day by day we are facing many fake news articles in the social media and by seeing it many people conclude that the news is real but when comes to the original fact the article shown is Fake.

> steps to follow the code

1. Download the fake news dataset from the above or get your own dataset.
2. Make sure there are no NAN values in the data 
3. follow the [ipynb](https://github.com/nithin42/fake-news-prediction-using-machine-learning/blob/main/fake_news_clasification.ipynb) file from the above to build the machine learning model
4. Test the model and get the accuracy sores
5. see you in the next project 

> Test my model
